The curry files in this directory thoroughly test the equality constraint
operator (=:=).  They can be run from the $root/tests directory with either of
the following commands:

    % ./run_tests func_eqconstr.py
    % ./cov_tests

Because there are so many tests, and because it takes a relatively long time
(several seconds per test case) to generate the ICurry and golden results,
the outputs of those steps are checked in to the repository.  Therefore,
running these tests just checks the behavior of Sprite.

Most users will not ever need to touch this directory.  There are three cases,
however, in which they might.  First, if the ICurry format changes, then the
.curry subdirectory can be removed to remove the ICurry files.  Running the
tests would then regenerate those files.  Second, to regenerate golden results,
remove the files ending with au-gen and then rerun the tests.

Finally, when tests are added or removed, then update the script
generate_test_programs.py with new tests, run it to generate new .curry files,
and then run the tests to generate ICurry and golden results.
