Sprite unit tests
=================

1. USAGE
--------

        make ['testall' | pattern...]

Use 'make' or 'make testall' to run all tests.  Use 'make test_parse.py' to run
parser tests.


2. FILE LAYOUT
--------------

        data/       Test data files (e.g., sample input, golden results).
        lib/        Test harness code.
        test_*.py   Unit test source code.


3. TEST RUNNERS
---------------

        run_tests       Run unit tests.
        debug_tests     Run unit tests under gdb.
        valgrind_tests  Run unit tests under valgrind.
        cov_tests       Run unit tests under coverage.py.
        shell           Start a shell in the test environment.


4. EDITOR INTEGRATION
---------------------

A makefile is used to simplify integration with text editors.  For instance, in
vim <Enter> runs "make" by default, so that key can be used to easily run the
tests right from the text editor.


5. TESTING-SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
-----------------------------------------

The following environment variables are available in the testing suite.  These
require that each test file imports 'cytest' before loading anything from the
'curry' package.

    - SPRITE_CATCH_ERRORS

        Default: ''
        Used at: tests/lib/cytest.py

        Sets a breakpoint whenever a specified error type is created.  The
        value is a comma-separated list of Python exception names.  For
        example, the value "AssertionError,RuntimeError" will cause an
        interactive prompt to start whenever either of those exceptions occurs.
