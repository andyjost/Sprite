Sprite unit tests
=================

1. USAGE
--------

        make ['testall' | pattern...]

Use 'make' or 'make testall' to run all tests.  Use 'make test_parse.py' to run
parser tests.


2. FILE LAYOUT
--------------

        data/       Test data files (e.g., sample input, golden results).
        lib/        Test harness code.
        test_*.py   Unit test source code.


3. TEST RUNNERS
---------------

        run_tests       Run unit tests.
        debug_tests     Run unit tests under gdb.
        valgrind_tests  Run unit tests under valgrind.
        cov_tests       Run unit tests under coverage.py.
        shell           Start a shell in the test environment.


4. EDITOR INTEGRATION
---------------------

A makefile is used to simplify integration with text editors.  For instance, in
vim <Enter> runs "make" by default, so that key can be used to easily run the
tests right from the text editor.
