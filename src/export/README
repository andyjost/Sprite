This directory contains scripts, links, and other files destined for the
installation tree.  The scripts are not intended to be called directly from
this location.  Instead, they will be staged to object-root/export and
ultimately copied to the installation.

Links to external programs appear in files with extension .link.  The content
of each files is the name of a Make variable that resolves to the target.
Corresponding links pointing to the target and with no extension will be
created in the staging area and installation tree.

Similarly, installation-time configuration variables appear in files with the
extension .var.  Each contains a Make expression that will be expanded to
the value of the configuration variable.  These are read by Sprite at runtime
to control behavior.
