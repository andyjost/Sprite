1. Description
--------------

This module builds MPS with the Sprite object format inlined.  See
http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/manual/html/guide/build.html#optimizing-for-your-object-format.

MPS is written in C, but the implementation of global (globals.cpp) variables
requires a dynamically-allocated list, and so is more conveniently implemented
using C++.
