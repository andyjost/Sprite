1. Makefile organization
------------------------

Sprite uses GNU "make" in straightforward fashion.  There are two things to
note:

    a. Make.include.  Each Makefile includes the Make.include file found one
       level higher in the filesystem tree.
    b. Make.depends.  The root contains this file, which implements dependency
       tracking.  Dependency files are placed under directories named .d.
