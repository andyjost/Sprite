- Add tests to tests/unit_parse.py and tests/unit_py_evaluation.py.  These
  should cover every construct that could be encountered in ICurry.
- Improve line coverage.  Run tests/cov_tests and add tests to reduce the
  number of uncovered lines.
- The Prelude takes forever to load.  Can't I just make an autoloader.
- This fails with _unreachable: curry.compile('1+2', mode='expr').
  Same goes for curry.compile('1 ? 2', mode='expr').  It seems to depend on
  using Ints.
- Refactor the func_* unit tests to reduce code duplication.
- Recursive bindings do not work:
      >>> a = curry.compile('''let a = True:b ; b = False:a in a''', 'expr')
      UnboundLocalError: local variable '_2' referenced before assignment
