- Add tests to tests/unit_parse.py and tests/unit_py_evaluation.py.  These
  should cover every construct that could be encountered in ICurry.
- Improve line coverage.  Run tests/cov_tests and add tests to reduce the
  number of uncovered lines.
- fix tests in unit_py_constraints.py
- fix tests in unit_py_pulltab.py
- At Python3 support without losing Python2.
- Come to think of it, I should remove the mutual recursion between D, N, and S.  All of the recusion should be done synthetically.
- curry.compile seems unable to import Control.SetFunctions
