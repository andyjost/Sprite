- Add tests to tests/unit_parse.py and tests/unit_py_evaluation.py.  These
  should cover every construct that could be encountered in ICurry.
- Improve line coverage.  Run tests/cov_tests and add tests to reduce the
  number of uncovered lines.
- The __file__ attribute of a Curry module should name the .curry file

    >>> __file__
    '/home/andy/sandbox/reverse/.curry/hello.json'

- The Prelude takes forever to load.  Can't I just make an autoloader.
- python -m curry actually loads the file as a module.  This could create
  problems for modules that import, since the directory containing the file
  must be added to curry.path.  It would be safer to load the file via its
  canonical path.
- This fails with _unreachable: curry.compile('1+2', mode='expr')
