- Add tests to tests/unit_parse.py and tests/unit_py_evaluation.py.  These
  should cover every construct that could be encountered in ICurry.
- Improve line coverage.  Run tests/cov_tests and add tests to reduce the
  number of uncovered lines.
- fix tests in unit_py_constraints.py
- fix tests in unit_py_pulltab.py
- Update to the latest icurry.
- Create a configure script to simply installation.
- Maybe create a simplified implementation of set functions that just
  normalizes the arguments.
- Create a minimal distro by stripping out unneeded libraries (LLVM, mps)
- Upgrade from Boost.Python to pybind11.
- Python3?
- Create a batch compile capability.

- Come to think of it, I should remove the mutual recursion between D, N, and S.  All of the recusion should be done synthetically.
- Finish testing set functions.
- Can I remove the dependency on expressions in the runtime?
- In runtime/currylib/setfunctions.py there is a call to graph.guard_args.  That function does not exist in that location.  Is that branch ever hit?
