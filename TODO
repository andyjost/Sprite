- Add tests to tests/unit_parse.py and tests/unit_py_evaluation.py.  These
  should cover every construct that could be encountered in ICurry.
- Improve line coverage.  Run tests/cov_tests and add tests to reduce the
  number of uncovered lines.
- This fails with _unreachable: curry.compile('1+2', mode='expr').
  Same goes for curry.compile('1 ? 2', mode='expr').  It seems to depend on
  using Ints.
- Recursive bindings do not work:
      >>> a = curry.compile('''let a = True:b ; b = False:a in a''', 'expr')
      UnboundLocalError: local variable '_2' referenced before assignment
- Move breakpoint into the curry module.
- Break down the Python runtime library.  It is too big.
- clean up the inspect module
- fix tests in unit_py_constraints.py
- fix tests in unit_py_pulltab.py
- clean up the imports in prelude_impl.py
- clean up the FIXME in interpreter/compile.py:82
