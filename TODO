- Add tests to tests/unit_parse.py and tests/unit_py_evaluation.py.  These
  should cover every construct that could be encountered in ICurry.
- Improve line coverage.  Run tests/cov_tests and add tests to reduce the
  number of uncovered lines.
- The Prelude takes forever to load.  Can't I just make an autoloader.
- This fails with _unreachable: curry.compile('1+2', mode='expr')
