- I'm trying to get a simple example compiling fib as a string to work.  It
  appears I need the full Prelude (need "failure," for instance, and surely
  more).

    - I also need "otherwise," but I can work around that for now.

- To get the prelude, I will copy from CMC/runtime/lib.  But there is already a
  Prelude module in the interpreter that defines the built-ins.  I somehow need
  to resolve this.

    - Maybe give the built-ins a special name like _Prelude.  And then merge
      the two with custom code.
    - Or is there an equivalent to 'from _Prelude import *' that I can put in
      the real prelude?  I don't think so, because the Prelude actually
      forward-declares, with "external," the things it expects the
      implementation to provide.
