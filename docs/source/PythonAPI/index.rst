====================
The Python Interface
====================

The Sprite Python API integrates a full-featured Curry compiler and runtime
environment into Python.  One can analyze, compile, link, load, and run Curry
programs from Python.  Data and control may cross the boundary between Python
and Curry.  In this way, the functional and logic capabilities are integrated
into an imperative setting, creating an unprecedented, fully integrated
programming environment.
