`Sprite`_ is a compiler and runtime for Curry programs.  It is based on the
`Fair Scheme`_, a compilation strategy for transforming declarative,
non-deterministic source programs into imperative, deterministic code.  As the
Fair Scheme emphasizes operational completeness, Sprite aims to produce all
values of Curry programs, subject only to practical limits such as the amount
of memory available.
