The subdirectories contain small examples showing how to use various aspects of
Sprite.

Before running these, you must "make install" Sprite and add its bin directory
to your path.  The default location relative to this file is ../install.

Run Python scripts using the Python wrapper installed with Sprite.  For example, if
Sprite is installed at the default location, then say:

    % ../../install/bin/python run.py
